/////Workflow

To create a wallet-based payment system for your project, where a portion of the total payment is deducted at regular intervals after booking a tutor, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the Requirements
User Roles: Users will have different roles, such as students and tutors. Students will make payments, and tutors will receive payments.
Payment Structure: The payment will be split, with an initial payment made at the time of booking and the remaining amount deducted periodically over time.
Wallet System: Users will have wallets where payments are stored. The wallet will be used to hold funds and process transactions.
Transaction Logging: Keep records of all transactions, including initial payments, interval payments, and withdrawals.
Step 2: Choose the Tech Stack
Here's a recommended tech stack to implement this feature:

Frontend:
React or Vue.js for building the user interface.
Redux or Vuex for state management (optional, if you need centralized state management).
Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for styling the components.
Backend:
Node.js with Express.js for building the server-side application.
MongoDB or PostgreSQL for database management to store user, wallet, and transaction details.
Payment Gateway Integration:
Stripe or PayPal: Use a payment gateway to handle the actual money transactions. Stripe supports split payments and interval-based deductions.
Crypto Wallets (optional): If you want to integrate cryptocurrency payments.
Additional Libraries/Tools:
Socket.io (optional): For real-time updates.
Cron Jobs (using node-cron or similar) for scheduling interval payments.
JWT for user authentication and authorization.
Step 3: Implement the Wallet System
Database Setup:

Users Table/Collection: Include fields for user details (name, email, role, etc.).
Wallets Table/Collection: Include fields for user ID, balance, payment history, etc.
Transactions Table/Collection: Store records of all transactions, including payment type, amount, date, and status.
Wallet Functions:

Add Funds to Wallet: Implement functions to add funds to a user's wallet.
Deduct Funds: Create functions to deduct funds periodically based on the time interval.
Refund Functionality: In case of cancellations or disputes, provide refund options.
Step 4: Implement Payment Gateway Integration
Set up Stripe or PayPal:

Configure a payment gateway account and obtain API keys.
Integrate payment functionality to allow users to add funds to their wallet.
Payment Flow:

Initial Payment: When a student books a tutor, deduct an initial portion of the total payment.
Periodic Deductions: Set up a scheduler (using node-cron or a similar library) to deduct a specified amount from the wallet periodically.
Automate Payments Using Webhooks:

Use webhooks to listen for payment events (e.g., successful deductions, failed payments).
Update the wallet and transaction records based on the payment events.
Step 5: Create a Scheduling and Notification System
Schedule Deductions: Use node-cron to schedule payment deductions at fixed intervals.
Notification System: Notify users of upcoming payments, successful payments, and any payment issues through email, SMS, or in-app notifications.
Step 6: Security and Compliance
Secure Payment Information: Use HTTPS, encrypt sensitive information, and comply with payment gateway requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS for Stripe).
User Authentication: Implement JWT-based authentication to ensure only authenticated users can access wallet functionalities.
Step 7: Testing and Deployment
Test Payment Scenarios: Simulate different payment scenarios, including successful payments, failed payments, refunds, and cancellations.
Deployment: Deploy the backend on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku) and the frontend on a static site host (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
Example Flow:
User Books a Tutor: Initial payment (say 20% of the total amount) is deducted from the wallet.
Studying Starts: The remaining 80% is deducted in equal installments at specified intervals (e.g., weekly).
Notification System: Users receive notifications before and after each payment.
Wallet Balance Monitoring: If the wallet balance is low, prompt the user to add more funds.
Tech Stack Summary
Frontend: React/Vue.js, Redux/Vuex, Tailwind CSS/Material-UI.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/PostgreSQL.
Payment Gateway: Stripe/PayPal.
Libraries: node-cron for scheduling, Socket.io for real-time updates, JWT for authentication.
This setup ensures a smooth payment flow with periodic deductions, secure transactions, and a user-friendly wallet-based experience.
